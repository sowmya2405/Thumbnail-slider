This repository contains a Node.js app and a React app. Here are the instructions for running them:

## Node.js App

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
   - This will start the server on port 3000 by default. You can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.
3. To build for production: `npm run build`
   - This will compile the TypeScript files and output the JavaScript files in the `dist` folder.
